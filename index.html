          <h3>Rule-Based Graph Cleaning with GPUs on a Single Machine</h3>
          <p class="publication-venue">
            <em>Proceedings of the ACM Management of Data</em>, 2025
          </p>
          <p class="publication-abstract">
            This paper studies cost-effective graph cleaning with a single machine. We adopt a rule-based method that may embed machine learning models as predicates in the rules. Graph cleaning with the rules involves rule discovery, error detection and correction. These tasks are both computation-heavy and I/O-intensive as they repeatedly invoke costly graph pattern matching, and produce a large amount of a large volume of intermediate results, among other things. In light of these, no existing single-machine system is able to carry out these tasks even on not-too-large graphs, even using GPUs. Thus we develop MiniClean, a single-machine system for cleaning large graphs. It proposes (1) a workflow that better fits a single machine by pipelining CPU, GPU and I/O operations; (2) memory footprint reduction with bundled processing and data compression; and (3) a multi-mode parallel model for SIMD, pipelined and independent parallelism, and their scheduling to maximize CPU--GPU synergy. Using real-life graphs, we empirically verify that MiniClean outperforms the SOTA single-machine systems by at least 65.34X and multi-machine systems with 32 nodes by at least 8.09X.

          <h3>Congestion-Aware Stackelberg Pricing Game in Urban Internet-of-Things Networks: A Case Study</h3>
          <p class="publication-venue">
            <em>Computer Networks</em>, 2024
          </p>
          <p class="publication-abstract">
            We consider a one-leader multi-follower Stackelberg pricing game in urban Internet-of-Things networks. The leader manages multiple services and sets service prices to maximize profit, while followers seek the most cost-effective services, taking into account service prices, service congestion, and individual locations. Existing approaches often simplify the game process by neglecting followers' locations, but they are not applicable to real-world complex spatial distributions. In this paper, we focus on the congestion-aware Stackelberg pricing game in urban Internet-of-Things networks, using electric vehicle charging as a case study. The game is reformulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) that considers both congestion effects and followers' spatial distributions. To solve the MPEC, we introduce the Segmentation-based Pricing with ITERative Optimization (SPITER) algorithm, which converges to a local maximum. Additionally, optimization techniques are developed to improve the performance of solving SPITER in urban environments. We evaluate the performance of SPITER using extensive experiments with two real-life urban datasets, demonstrating the advantages of our model and illustrating SPITER's effectiveness and convergence.

          <h3>(Neural ◦ Symbolic ◦ Neural)(Everything): The Onion Framework for Modern Query Engines</h3>
          <p class="publication-venue">
            September 29, 2025
          </p>
          <p class="publication-abstract">
            Academic database (DB) research must pivot from marginal RDBMS gains ("polishing a round ball") to find the "New Chalice of Data," driven by the massive shift in funding toward AI (>$100B VC funding). Modern Query Engines must evolve away from the closed-world assumption, SQL, and relational data to embrace unstructured multi-modal data and Natural Language queries in an open-world model, shifting core capability from retrieval to reasoning.
            <br><br><br>
            This abstract outlines "The Onion Framework" (Neural ◦ Symbolic ◦ Neural) for integrating and optimizing Large Language Model (LLM)-powered data processing.
            <br><br><br>
            The Symbolic ◦ Neural approach focuses on steering LLM queries via explicit control under declarative frameworks (e.g., Palimpzest, ELEET). Effectiveness is enhanced using prompt engineering strategies, such as fine-grained methods for accuracy and leveraging non-LLM proxies (like k-NN) to reduce token consumption by 50%. Efficiency optimization utilizes model cascades (BARGAIN), proxy-based approximation (LOTUS), and unbiased stratified sampling for aggregation queries (UQE). These methods require user-specified logic flow.
            <br><br><br>
            The Neural ◦ Symbolic ◦ Neural approach focuses on automatically manipulating symbols to improve accessibility by converting Natural Language queries into formal query plans (NL2SQL) using progressive matching. Optimization strategies include exploiting independent parallelism (AOP), cost-based optimization using importance sampling for cardinality estimation (Unify), and online plan adjustment and fault tolerance (iDataLake).
            <br><br><br>
            Ultimately, database researchers are uniquely positioned to address LLM challenges (poor predictability, undefined correctness). Our competitive advantage lies in fundamental principles such as declarativeness, cost-based optimization, approximation guarantees, and performance optimization.

          <h3>Recent Advances in Pessimistic Cardinality Estimation</h3>
          <p class="publication-venue">
            July 29, 2025
          </p>
          <p class="publication-abstract">
            Pessimistic Cardinality Estimation (PCE) is a core topic in database query optimization, designed to counter the fragility of standard cardinality estimation—often called the "Achilles Heel" of cost estimation. PCE addresses this by finding a guaranteed tight upper bound U such that the result size of a query |Q(D)| is always less than or equal to U for any database instance D consistent with available statistics. This provides a valuable one-sided theoretical guarantee for query planning. The presentation focuses on Full Conjunctive Queries (FCQs) and uses statistics that adhere to the locality desideratum, meaning they are computed independently on each relation. 
            <br><br><br>
            We review the progression of PCE bounds based on the statistics utilized: the foundational AGM Bound, which uses only relation cardinalities and is provably tight; the Chain Bound, which incorporates max-degree (L-infinity-norm) statistics and outperforms AGM on acyclic queries; and the Polymatroid Bound, which integrates various Lp-norms by leveraging concepts from information theory, though it is generally not tight due to exponential inference time. The most recent advancement is the Degree Sequence Bound, which accesses the full degree sequences. This bound is provably tight for Berge-acyclic queries, is compositional, and can be computed efficiently. Performance evaluation of the state-of-the-art LpBound system confirms that PCE improves performance for expensive SQL queries but can lead to regression for computationally cheap queries. Furthermore, the utility gained from incorporating increasing amounts of Lp-norms follows the law of diminishing returns. PCE successfully provides theoretical guarantees and adheres to locality.
